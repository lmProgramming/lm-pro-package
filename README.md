# LM Pro Package

This is a collection of utilities that come in handy in almost any Unity Project I use (at least some of them).

## Installation

First, make sure you installed excellent [Git Dependency Resolver](https://github.com/mob-sakai/GitDependencyResolverForUnity), as this package uses Git dependencies (UniTask and Extenject). Then, add this package via Package Manager/Install package from git URL with this argument:

```sh
https://github.com/lmProgramming/lm-pro-package.git
```

## Features

- EasyPool - simple pool implementation
- Graph - basic graphs
- simple SoundManager
- DefaultDictionary like in Python
- image orientation helpers
- GameInput for getting inputs quickly
- GridMarcher (collect points from A to B on 2D grid) and GridRegionFinder (find "islands" of pixels)
- extensions for Math and Vectors
- SimpleTimer
